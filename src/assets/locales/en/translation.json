    "title": "About Me",
    "text": "<3>Hey! I'm Carlos Curiel, </3> a former psychotherapist and music therapist turned <1>web developer </1>, with a deep interest in human behavior and a passion for building useful, meaningful digital experiences.\n\nFor years, I dedicated myself to helping people understand and transform their lives through psychology, working closely with individuals in therapeutic contexts. That background has given me a strong foundation in empathy, active listening, and problem-solving – skills I now channel into tech.\n\nAt some point, I realized I wanted to explore another way to solve problems: through code. I joined a full-time web development bootcamp, where I learned to build full-stack applications using <2>JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and SQL.</2> It was like therapy – but for the web.\n\nI’m especially drawn to frontend development and the logic behind it, I also enjoy creating clean, accessible UIs. I’ve worked on projects like a rental management platform  and a responsive CV site built with Vite.\n\n<2>Right now, I’m focused on improving my skills, contributing to open-source projects, and looking for my first opportunity in tech.</2>\n\n I'm driven by curiosity, discipline, and a love for turning abstract ideas into real, interactive products.\n\nThanks for reading – feel free to check out my projects!"
